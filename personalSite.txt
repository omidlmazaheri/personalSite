When designing a single-page website with SEO considerations, ensure you optimize the content with relevant keywords and meta tags. Use schema markup where applicable, such as the "Person" schema for personal information. Additionally, focus on providing high-quality and engaging content to keep visitors on the page and encourage them to explore further.

Remember, a single-page website relies heavily on scrolling, so ensure smooth navigation and seamless transitions between sections. Also, pay attention to responsive design, ensuring the website looks and functions well on different devices and screen sizes.
